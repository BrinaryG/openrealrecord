# openrealrecord

Provides for a tree of binary streams that are immutable, authenticated, provable, decentralized, and censorship-resistant.

Streams may be public or private.  Uses hyperdb and hypercore, backends of dat.

The design of openrealrecord should be suitable for recording information that could threaten very powerful entities.  This has not been tested, nor has the software been reviewed for bugs or security concerns.
